# Supercell website revamp

With a total revenue of approximately 1.87 billion USD and a reported
666.31 million USD for its Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (EBITDA) in the year 2022 (Supercell Annual Revenue 2022 | Statista, 2023). However in the recent years, Supercell has been losing players and has been dropping in popularity around the world. Agreed that Supercell's games have good early, mid and late retention cycles but there are other factors such as the community and listening to the community also play a role in the retention of players. For example, in the latest Clash Royale update titled "The update for losers". The community got mad because most felt that the update did not benefit them but rather, made the game even more pay to win which means that players needed to pay even more money in order to get stronger and better units so as to defeat opponents in-game (Orange Juice Gaming, 2023). Other observed potential problems could be that new players are matched against veteran players due to a possible shortage of new players. As such new players may quit the game due to what they believe is unfair matchmaking. At about 13 years old, there is much potential in the company and its games, but greater international recognition and more players are needed to take the company to greater heights.

 
## Design Process
 
 - To attract more players; currently Supercell is more popular amongst younger audiences because of their more popular games but could overshadowed by other more popular games due to external factors such as local news and peer pressure. Some examples are Valorant ( Cue, 2023 ) and Mobile Legends Bang Bang ( Cue, 2023 a). Additionally, the maker must also be made known to the other age groups so that people know that Supercell is not only known for one good game but many.

 - Make the website more user-friendly for all target audiences.

 - Current website design lacks information about what
each game is about, static website design which makes it unattractive.


- Link to all wireframes: https://www.figma.com/file/z3MgBGIYO3AhtqMhQwLNgD/Supercell?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=VKYcRT8xsiYZJXkt-1


In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:
- As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. 
These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory)
Include the Adobe XD wireframe as a folder. You can include the XD share url. 

## Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.
 
### Existing Features
- Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
- To the surface button at the bottom of every webpage excluding the sign in page so that the user can easily scroll to the top.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement/ Additional features to be implemented in the future
- Revamp each game's webpage and include a section where viewers can see what in-game characters look like, and maybe collaborate with Google Play Games to create a demo environment for viewers to have try out the game. (Google Play Games is on PC, mobile and tablet, hence the choice of possible collaboration). 

- Changing the language of the text on the website.

- A section of the website to feature community artworks.

## Testing

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

### Acknowledgements

- While this project was based of a real life gaming company which I like, I would like to thank my lecturer Mr Brian Toh Eng Kiat for teaching me on how to program in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, w3schools for portions which were slightly more advanced in my opinion. Next, I would also like to thank my design principle lecturer Ms Christina Mok and friends Muhammad Hafiezul Haq, Pang Jun Hao, Jeffrey Lee and Crystal Ng for their opinions on how I could make my website look more appealing as well as the various suggestions they offered with regards to the features that are good to have.
