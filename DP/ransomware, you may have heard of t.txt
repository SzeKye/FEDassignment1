ransomware, you may have heard of this term before maybe it was during a discussion or perhaps you encountered one before? Man that must have been a terrible experience. But did you know ransomware is a rather diverse topic and one can trace its roots back to 1989 where the first recorded ransomware case was targeted at the healthcare industry. Well, not much change to its targets eh? Sit back relax and enjoy our presentation about ransomware
    
Now let me tell you more about RaaS, which is ransomware as a service. RaaS  is essentially a business model  that is a variation of software as a service. Customers who purchase RaaS kits usually lack the time or do not have the skills to write ransomware codes of their own. The money gained from the attack is divided between the ransomware developer and the buyer, however there are also other revenue models such as a one time license fee with no profit sharing or a monthly subscription with a flat fee. A real world example of RaaS would be darkside. Darkside operators primarily target Windows operating systems and it was also found by the FBI that darkside ransomware was involved in the Colonial pipeline attack.

Moving on, doxware is  basically doxing ransomware. similar to other types of ransomware, files are encrypted and a ransom is demanded. However, doxware takes a step further with the threat of publishing the encrypted information online which more often than not tends to be sensitive information such as company secrets or login credentials. An example of doxware will be Lockbit 3.0. From the lockbit ransomware family, lockbit 3.0 encrypts and exfiltrates all files on the infected device. It is most notable for exploiting windows defender to deploy cobalt strike, a commercial penetration testing tool for ethical hackers, but in the wrong hands it can cause a lot of damage as it allows the attacker to get past the windows defender security measures and unleash a devastating payload.
